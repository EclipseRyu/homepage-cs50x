                Hi! Welcome to my HTML sandbox! <br>
                Here, I'll just be dinking around with HTML to get comfortable with it's syntax! <br>
                What you're reading now is just an introductory paragraph to say hi! <br>
                Below, you'll find more stuff that's just me dinking around and learning HTML basics. <br>
                Also, I may dink with some simple CSS, nothing crazy enough to warrant a .css file though.

                Back in May (of 2025), I saved up enough money to get this silly little laptop (a Lenovo Thinkpad) <br>
                Nevermind, I'm done yapping. I already know enough HTML to move on to CSS.
